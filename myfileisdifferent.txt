All the world's a stage...

git diff           < diff of what is changed but not staged
git diff --staged  < diff of what is staged but not committed
git diff HEAD      < diff of the current state of the files as compared against the most recent commit

git show <hash>    < diff of a specific commit

git log origin/master..master             < lists unpushed commits
git log origin/master..master --oneline


git commit --amend < change last commit message

git reset --hard HEAD  < Restore working to last committed state
git reset --hard       < same
